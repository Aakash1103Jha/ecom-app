# ecom-app

A small micro-frontend demo app. Each MFE app in this app can work as a standalone app in itself, and also can be integrated using Webpack, into `container` MFE app.

                |-- index.js
          |-- package.json
          |-- webpack.config.js

`cart` and `products` are essentially the two pieces (Micro-Frontend App) of the whole ecom-app, which will then be **Integrated** in the `container` MFE app.

## Stack

-   HTML
-   Vanilla JS
-   Webpack (and ModuleFederationPlugin to enable code sharing between MFE apps.)
